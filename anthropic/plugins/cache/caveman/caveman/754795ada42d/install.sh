# Thin wrapper around bin/install.js (the unified Node installer). Every flag
# you'd pass to bin/install.js can be passed here; we just forward them.
#
# One-line install:
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman/main/install.sh | bash
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --all
#
# Local clone:
#   bash install.sh [flags]
#
# Why a Node installer? install.sh + install.ps1 used to be parallel sources
# of truth and constantly drifted (issue #249, etc.). One Node script works
# everywhere without bash/PowerShell quoting bugs.
